Introduction to |GB|
====================

What is |GB|
------------

* |GB| is an open source Java enterprise application for the collection, processing and publication of geospatial data in real time.
* |GB| is a processing engine aimed towards the processing of geographic data. 
* |GB| is an event-based geospatial aware batch processing system to ease the development, deploying, and management of tasks as streams of geospatial data. |GB| provides basic components for the collection, processing and publication of data.

|GB|'s basic idea is to apply a **chain of actions** on some defined events. The predefined *event generators* include monitoring for new files added to a directory, or receiving files in the embedded FTP server. *Actions* range from geotransforming an input raster file, to embedding overviews, to publishing the received data into a public |GS|.

|GB| also provides **user profiles**, in order to give different users the privileges to admin the processes or to monitor the processes status.

Why use |GB|
------------

Because it is **free software**. This significantly lowers the financial barrier to entry when compared to traditional products. In addition, not only is it available free of charge, it is also **open source**. Bug fixes and feature improvements in open source software are greatly accelerated when compared to privative software solutions. Leveraging |GB| in your organization also prevents software lock-in, saving costy support contracts down the road.

Who develops |GB|
-----------------
